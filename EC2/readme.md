## **What is Amazon EC2?**

Amazon EC2 is a web service that offers secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to simplify cloud-based computing and provide developers with scalable, flexible, and cost-effective resources.

### **Key Features of EC2**
- **Elasticity**: Scale compute resources up or down as required.
- **Customizability**: Choose from a wide variety of instance types tailored to specific use cases.
- **Secure**: Integrated with AWS IAM for fine-grained access control.
- **Wide OS Support**: Supports Linux, Windows, and custom AMIs.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works well with other AWS services (e.g., S3, RDS, Lambda).
- **Flexible Pricing Models**:
  - **On-Demand**: Pay as you go.
  - **Reserved**: Reduced cost for long-term commitments.
  - **Savings Plans**: Flexible cost-saving options.
  - **Spot Instances**: Utilize spare capacity for discounted rates.
